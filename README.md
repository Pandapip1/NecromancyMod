(Please note: This video is from a *way* earlier version)

Pandapip1's Necromany Mod is a mod that allows the Impostors (Necromancers) to see ghosts. In addition, they can 'Call Ghost,' causing all nearby ghosts to become *Ghouls*, who are visible to all players and attack the nearest crewmate. Ghouls have a *very low* kill cooldown (.5 seconds), but crewmates are not completely defenseless. Crewmates (and Impostors) can 'Zap' all nearby Ghouls, reverting them to normal ghosts. The range for the Zap button is 3 times the kill distance and the call ghost button's range is 2 times the kill distance.
